HTML
----

Text between `<` and `>` that looks like an HTML tag is parsed as a raw HTML tag and will be rendered in HTML

While it may be useful when writing online content, please note that your tag may be stripped for security reasons and in output other than HTML you may have unexpected results

<p class="text-right">Look I'm right!</p>

This is the list of allowed html tags (case insensitive):

`article`, `header`, `aside`, `hgroup`, `blockquote`, `hr`, `iframe`, `body`, `li`, `map`, `button`, `object`, `canvas`, `ol`,`caption`, `output`, `col`, `p`, `colgroup`, `pre`, `dd`, `progress`, `div`, `section`, `dl`,`table`, `td`, `dt`, `tbody`, `embed`,`textarea`, `fieldset`, `tfoot`, `figcaption`, `th`, `figure`, `thead`, `footer`, `tr`, `form`, `ul`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `video

If you have to insert code in your document you have three choices:

 1. inline code like this: `*Hello* **world!**"`
 2. fenced code blocks (you may use ` ``` ` or `~~~` 
   as delimiters): 
``` markdown
*Hello* **world!**
```
 3. indented code blocks


    *Hello* 
    
    **world!**

You need to leave a blank linke after a paragraph and 2 blank lines after a list to start an indented code block (if you want the code to be out of the list), and you may insert the name of the language immediatly after the opening code fence (so some renderers may be able to highlight the syntax of the language)
